        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Sophia Bueno and I am currently a seond-year public policy major at the University of California, Riverside. I currently serve on the Executive Board for my sorority. I serve as the VP of Membership Experience. I was nominated into this position to be responsible for serving the needs of Chapter Membership. My team oversees every phase of membership in the chapter including new members, current members, and alumni. Some of my responsibilities include planning chapter retreat, transitioning seniors into life after graduation, and being a support system to our new members. I also prepare our new members for initiation and I help them through every phase of their membership in Alpha Delta Pi. In my position, I make sure our ritual is being followed and hold sisters accountable to ensure they are doing everything correctly. 
<br><br>

        During the summer before my first year of college, I became a soccer coach. I was responsible for coaching children from ages two to ten. I would teach them the basics of soccer and helped them learn how to dribble, pass, and shoot. When I was a coach, I would lead small classes of about ten children. I learned how to work with children from all different backgrounds and different levels of experience when it came to soccer. Some of the children I worked with were only toddlers and many of them did not understand how to properly play soccer. For them, I would incorporate fun games for them to play and I would also ask for their parents to step in to help them with certain movements. For some students, I had to help them a little more than others. I was there to encourage them and support them when they had difficulty learning a new move or drill. This job taught me to have patience and have a positive attitude when working with new people. It was a very rewarding experience and I would definitely love to be a coach again some day. 
<br><br>

        Overall, I am a very outgoing and positive person. I love learning new things and having new experiences. I am always up for a challenge. I love working with new people and I am always willing to improve myself. In my experience with my different jobs, I have come across and have worked along side so many people. This has helped prepare me for any setting in the workforce and has made me extremely adaptable. I am now looking to further my education and earn my Bachelorâ€™s degree in public policy or in public health. I hope to one day earn an internship in the public health field. I want to make a change and an impact on other people as well.
